## SingleVC: Any2-to-one voice conversion

SingleVC performs A2O VC through a self-supervised task(\emph{X$_{i}$} $\to$ $\hat{\emph{X$_{i}^{s}$}}$ $\to$ $\hat{\emph{X$_{i}$}}$).  $\hat{\emph{X$_{i}^{s}$}}$ is  a PSDR-processed speech with pitch-shifted $s$. The more details can be access here.

This page provides converted speeches samples. The pretrained model is trained with p249(female, 22.5-minute) from VCTK corpus.
